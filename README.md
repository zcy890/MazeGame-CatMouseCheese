# MazeGame-CatMouseCheese
# This is a maze game similar to Pac Man and was done in collaboration with Jessie Tran.
# The player controls a mouse in search of some pieces of cheese while avoiding the cats to win the game.
# Generated the maze using the Depth First Search algorithm and added cycles (loops) to the maze
# The server was implemented to use a REST interface to support a web-based UI.
